### ESP32-based wireless water tank level monitor

This is a wireless water tank level monitor, based on the NodeMCU / ESP32 dev-kit microcontroller.

The water level is measured using a HC-SR04 ultrasonic range-finder, temperature-compensated with measurements from a DHT11 one-wire humidity/temperature sensor.

Measurements are transmitted on the 433MHz scientific/instrumentation band using a HC-12 transceiver.
